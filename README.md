Installation

Copy the "module" folder inside the root folder of your dolphin installation using your favorite FTP tool. The folder "module" should already exist. Replace it´s contents.
After that, log in to your dolphin administration area, choose the main menu "Tools" and click on "Module" in the opening window.
The Add Member plugin should appaer in the "not installed modules" box. Check the checkbox before "Add Member" and click on "Install". That´s it!
New mebers can now be created inside "Module" > "Add Member".
