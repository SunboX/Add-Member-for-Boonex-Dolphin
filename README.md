Installation

Copy the "module" folder inside the root folder of your dolphin installation using your favorite FTP tool. The folder "module" should already exist. Replace it´s contents.
After that, log in to your dolphin administration area, choose the main menu "Tools" and click on "Module" in the opening window.
The Google Maps Directions Page plugin should appaer in the "not installed modules" box. Check the checkbox before "Google Maps Directions Page" and click on "Install". That´s it!
The new page should be placed in the top menu of your site. You can re-arrange it in the "Builder".
Last thing you have to do is inserting your adress and changing your map settings. Settings can be done inside "Module" > "Directions".
